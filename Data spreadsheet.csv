The date an exemption under 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective: August 5, 1988. The applicant claims July 10, 1988, as the date the investigational new drug application (IND) for Zosyn<Register> (IND 31,705) became effective. However, IND 31,705 was received on June 14, 1988, and it was placed on clinical hold on July 1, 1988. It was removed from clinical hold on August 5, 1988, making the IND effective date August 5, 1988. This document corrects those errors. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brian J.
